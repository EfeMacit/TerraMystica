# **Terra Mystica**

## **Project Description** :checkered_flag:

  
In the land of Terra Mystica there are 14 groups within seven different terrains and each group have their own home terrain. In order to grow and develop they must transform the neighouring terrains into their home terrain. Wso to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.

Terra Mystica is 2 to 5 player full information game without any luck that rewards strategic planning. There are 14 different groups which are called as factions. The objective of the game is gaining as much as Victory points possible which can be done in several ways. Geographical expansion and cult development is just an example. There are a few other ways to get points, such as upgrading your abilities, founding cities, favor tiles and bonus cards. In geogropihcl expansion players try to rule as much area possible while developing power of the adjacent groups as well. There are also four religious cults in which you can develope. To do all that, each group has their own special skills and abilities.

Each round, players will take turns and use their resources to take actions. There are various type of buildings in Terra Mystica. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. By improving shipping skills players will gain ability to indirect transformation of land via being able to use land across the river area to build buildings.

The 7 Terrains and 14 Factions as follows: 

- Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)
- Plains (Halflings, Cultists)
- Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)
- Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)
- Forest (Witches, Auren)
- Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)
- Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)

Being close to other groups is a trade-off in Terra Mystica. It gives the player extra power, but it also makes expanding more difficult in future rounds...
