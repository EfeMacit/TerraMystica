1. Usability as a nonfunctional requirement must be analytically testable.
2. Updates should result in entity objects, i.e., entity objects should not update control objects.
3. In the presentation, class diagrams should come first for clarity.
4. State diagrams should be used when there are clear states to consider and states should be described in short.
5. Rounds of the game should be in an activity diagram. (Loops may be introduced.)
6. Factions should be more detailed in the design.
7. Introducing a GameFlowManager class would benefit.
8. Player class needs to be simplified. It should only represent an entity object.
9. Controller classes should be added and diversified.
